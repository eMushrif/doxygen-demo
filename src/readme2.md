# Welcome to Doxygen Demo

This is a sample project to show how to use [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) for code documentation.

Doxygen is a tool to generate documentation viewable as webpage by extracting comments from the your code.

Doxygen is an app that can be [installed](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/install.html) on your device and it works by adding a configuration file (`Doxyfile`) in your project and running it using `doxygen -g` command to generate the documentation, or using [Doxywizard UI](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/doxywizard_usage.html) that comes with the software.

Normally, you wouldn't have to manipulate Doxygen configurations or learn about them. But as a developer, you would need to learn the right syntax that would make your code comments understandable for Doxygen and enables it to generate documentation.

You can preview the output of this project from this link, and it would be a good idea to compare the script/code in the repository to see how script is translated into documentation.
