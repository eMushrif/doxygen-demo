\page pwr-mon Power Sources & Monitoring

There are 3 power sources:

- Vehicle's battery: If your device is designed for use in a vehicle, it may be powered by the vehicle's battery. This is a convenient power source, as it means that your device will always be powered while the vehicle is running. However, it is important to design your firmware with the possibility of power fluctuations or interruptions in mind, as the vehicle's battery may not always provide a consistent power supply.

- Device's backup battery: Many devices have a backup battery that can be used in the event of a power failure or outage. This backup battery is designed to keep the device powered for a short period of time, allowing users to save their work or shut down the device properly. As a firmware developer, it is important to ensure that your device's firmware is able to detect when the backup battery is in use and adjust its behavior accordingly.

- USB port: Finally, many devices can be powered via a USB port. This is a convenient power source, as it allows users to charge their device from a variety of different sources, including laptops, wall chargers, and car chargers. However, it is important to ensure that your device's firmware is able to detect when it is being powered via USB and adjust its behavior accordingly, as the power supply from a USB port may not always be consistent or reliable.

\page pwr-consumption Expected Power Consumption

Power consumption largely depends on network module and some peripherals.

\section pwr-netmodule Network module power consumption

When a network modem connects through a mobile network, the power consumption of the modem can be affected by a number of different factors. These factors can include the strength of the mobile signal, the amount of data being transmitted, and the type of mobile network being used.

One factor that can affect the power consumption of a network modem when connecting through a mobile network is the strength of the mobile signal. If the signal is weak, the modem may consume more power as it works to maintain the connection. Additionally, if the modem is located in an area with poor reception, it may need to use more power to transmit and receive data, which can further increase power consumption.

The amount of data being transmitted can also affect the power consumption of a network modem. Modems that are transferring large amounts of data, such as when streaming video or downloading large files, may consume more power than modems that are used for more basic tasks such as browsing the web or checking email.

Finally, the type of mobile network being used can also affect power consumption. For example, 5G networks typically consume more power than 4G networks, as they require more advanced hardware and processing power to establish and maintain the connection.

\section pwr-periph Peripherals power consumption

Device peripherals, such as LEDs, buzzers, motion detectors, and sirens, can consume varying amounts of power depending on their design and usage.

\subsection pwr-led LED

LEDs are commonly used to indicate the status of a device or to provide visual feedback to the user. The power consumption of an LED can vary depending on its brightness and color. Brighter LEDs and those that emit colors other than red typically require more power to operate. It is important to use energy-efficient LEDs and to optimize the design of the circuitry that powers them in order to minimize power consumption.

\subsection pwr-buzz Buzzer

Buzzer is an audio output device that produces a buzzing or beeping sound. The power consumption of a buzzer can vary depending on its volume and the frequency of the sound it produces. Louder and higher frequency buzzers typically require more power to operate. To minimize power consumption, it is important to choose a buzzer with low power consumption and to design the circuitry that powers it in an energy-efficient manner.

\subsection pwr-pir Motion Detectors

Motion detectors are commonly used to detect movement and trigger an event or alarm. The power consumption of a motion detector can vary depending on its sensitivity and the frequency of its detection. More sensitive motion detectors and those that detect motion more frequently typically require more power to operate. It is important to choose a motion detector with low power consumption and to optimize its use in order to minimize power consumption.

\subsection pwr-siren Siren

Sirens are used to emit a loud and attention-grabbing sound to alert users to a potential danger or event. The power consumption of a siren can vary depending on its volume and frequency. Louder sirens and those that emit higher frequency sounds typically require more power to operate. It is important to choose a siren with low power consumption and to use it only when necessary in order to minimize power consumption.
